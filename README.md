# Retail DB Management System

This project is a SQL-based retail database management system that simulates the core functionality of a retail store. It involves setting up a database (`RetailDB`) and creating multiple tables to manage products, customers, orders, suppliers, and order details.

## Features:
- **Products Table**: Store product information such as name, category, price, and stock quantity.
- **Customers Table**: Store customer data including personal details and contact information.
- **Orders Table**: Record customer orders along with the total amount and order status.
- **OrderDetails Table**: Maintain details of individual products included in each order.
- **Suppliers Table**: Manage supplier information and track the sources of product supplies.

## Usage:
- Run the SQL script to set up the database and its tables.
- Modify and extend the system to suit custom retail management use cases.

## How to Execute:
1. Execute the script in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
2. Ensure that all foreign key relationships between tables are maintained correctly.

## Requirements:
- SQL Server or any compatible database management system.
